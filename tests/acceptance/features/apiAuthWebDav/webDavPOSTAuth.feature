  Background:
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "Alice" has uploaded file with content "some data" to "/textfile1.txt"
    And user "Alice" has created folder "/PARENT"

  Scenario: send POST requests to webDav endpoints as normal user with wrong password
    When user "Alice" sends "POST" request on these endpoints with body "doesnotmatter" using password "invalid" about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
      | /remote.php/webdav/textfile0.txt                   |

      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT            |
      | /remote.php/dav/files/%username%/PARENT/parent.txt |
    Then the HTTP status code of responses on all endpoints should be "401"

  Scenario: send POST requests to webDav endpoints using token authentication should not work
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user sends "POST" request on these endpoints using the generated app password about user "Alice"

  Scenario: send POST requests to webDav endpoints using app password token as password
    Given token auth has been enforced
    And a new browser session for "Alice" has been started
    And the user has generated a new app password named "my-client"
    When the user "Alice" sends "POST" request on these endpoints using the basic auth and generated app password about user "Alice"
      | endpoint                                           |
